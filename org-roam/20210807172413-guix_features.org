* Multiple Outputs
  A package can have multiple “outputs” that serves as a mean to separate
  various component of a program (libraries, extra tools, documentation, etc.).

* Non-propagated Inputs
  “Inputs,” in Guix parlance, are the package
  dependencies. The user profile and environment only contains the packages the
  user explicitly installed and not necessarily the dependencies of those
  packages.
