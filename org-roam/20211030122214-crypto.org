;; hyperleddger: open-source project developed by the Linux foundation. It uses
;; a modular approach to building blockchains collective of open-source
;; blockchains and tools that anyone can use to create their own distributed
;; ledgers.

Byzantine Fault Tolerances / Consensus methods:
https://link.medium.com/V2dglrC5UU
- distributed systems with imperfect information if a component failed
Proof of Work         Bitcoin
Proof of Stake        Cardano
Proof of Activity     mix of PoW & PoS
Proof of Burn         proof of coins "burned". I.e. sent to unspendable addresses
Proof of Capacity     i.e. Proof of Space. Allocate lots of memory or disk space. Similar to PoW. Instead of computation storage is used

BGP - The Byzantine Generals Problem:
A groupf generals have to come to a common agreement on whether to attack or
retreat, but can communicate only by sending messengers who might never arrive.
Some of whom may be traitors, who have to reach a common decision.

PoW (Proof of Work)
- Consensus algorithm used by Bitcoin i.e. a solution of the BGP
- Cost of registration, investing a scarce resource - electricity used to solve a math (arbitrary) puzzle creates trust
- election of a leader - randomized, one CPU = one vote
- mining pools - decrease randomisation, unwanted centralisation

A generalised solution to distributed consensus:

Cardano - uses Ouroboros algorith for PoS (Proof of Stake)
The currency itself is the scare resource
each time slot, randomly pick one coin, it's owner produces a block
different leader selection - weighted by stake, the more coins you have the higher chance of getting elected for the next block
holder of a large amount of coins has a better chance of attacking the system - if people notice the currency gets devaluated -> this forces you to play honest?
SRSLY??? Quod licet Iovi, non licet bovi
Explicit decentralized & unpredictable randomness generator everybody agrees on
Ouroboros protocol
- Split time into slots, each slot will have a block, a stakeholder is elected for a slot leader and has a right to create a new block.
  Slots grouped into an epoch, before the start of an epoch all stakeholder have to agree on some seed for the next random generator
- Private dice roll, the send a proof of "the dice is cast" to the bchain, then the rand numers and combined and the seed is created
- has a Proof of Security (written in Haskell)- for participants having less than a half of the stake (all ADA coins)
Ouroboros Praos - Ouroboros extention: What happens if messages are delayed
Process Calculi - model of distributed systems modeled in terms of runnable processes comunicating via channels
measurement of process similarity or interchangeability, observational equivalence, equational reasoning, bisimilarity
compositional language
Process Calculi: examples: CCS, CSP, ACP, Ï€ - calculus
Psi Calculus
