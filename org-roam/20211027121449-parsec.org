#+title: Parsec

* Parsing stages
  (sometimes divided into two) stages:
  - lexical analysis; see [[https://cobweb.cs.uga.edu/~kochut/teaching/x570/tools/flex.pdf][flex]] - the tool for generating scanners; recognition
    of lexical patterns
  - parsing itself; see [[https://www.gnu.org/software/bison/][bison]] - the general-purpose parser generator that
    converts an annotated context-free grammar into a deterministic LR or
    generalized LR (GLR) parser employing LALR(1) parser tables.

* Parsec
  - Parser combinator library
  - Combine small parsing functions to build more sophisticated parsers
  - Can perform both lexical analysis and parsing
