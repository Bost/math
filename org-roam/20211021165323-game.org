#+title: Game

A set of objects/object-types and a set of morphism/actions between the objects/object-types

* Object-types
** Examples:
   - a set of game-actors. E.g.: animals, persons, etc.
   - a set of environment-objects. E.g.: buildings, roads, furniture, etc.
   - a set of items. E.g.: that particular computer I'm writing this email on
   - a set of game-states

* Morphisms/Actions
** Examples:
   upgrade-item, go-left, drop-item, sun-rise, sun-set, rainfall
** morphism/action acts on one or multiple objects
   object1, objec2, ..., objectN -> object
** pure actions vs. actions with side effects
   Examples:
   - do-step-forward does not change the world
   - do-eat-apple changes the state-of-world (environment-context). One apple
     disappeared from the world.

* game-world timespace characteristics
** time-flow:
   turn based games vs. real-time games, with events happening simultaneously.
** space-topology, -boundaries, -dimensions, -tilling, -???
   Examples:
   - just a (set of) few places with a (set of) few transitions between them
   - planar-world with edges and boundaries (e.g. chess board)
   - torus, sphere, circle (e.g. the (Monopoly circle)
   - number of dimensions: 1D, 2D, 3D
   - with boundaries. i.e. edges, corners, walls, etc. E.g. chess boards
   - no boundaries: "going full circle around the world"
   - world-tilling: hexagons, squares, triangles, etc.
   - the "funny" stuff: MÃ¶bius stripe
    
* game-theme
** Examples:
   middle-ages, winter

* Order/Hierarchy relations among the elements of an object-type:
** Examples:
*** game-states
    - a subset of end-states of the game: i.e. the state of the game where the
      game-over message is displayed.
    - a subset of intermediary game-states
    - a subset start-states of the game
*** Any porcelain-cup is at least as good as any wooden-cup:
    wooden-cups <= porcelain-cups

* rendering-engine, game-physics, ???
  gravitation, object visibility, etc.
    
* Invariants/invariant-conditions
  "the world must make sense": always valid facts, no matter what morphism/action happens.
** Examples:
   - nr. of available vaccination-shots before and after the morphis/action of
     vaccination must differ by exactly one.    
   - start-state can be an end-state at the same time, however an end-state
     cannot be reached before reaching a start-state:
       `start-state <= intermediary-state <= end-state`

* Production rules and product-types
  - denoted by the cross 'x'
  - "bringing together" i.e. "pairing" a set of steel-needles with a set of
    empty-plastic-barrels give rise to the set of empty-syringes:
     `steel-needles x empty-plastic-barrels -> empty-syringes`

* Identity morphism/action
  - for every object-type
  - the do-nothing action: take something and do-nothing with it.
    (i.e. the multiplication by 1)

* Morphism/Action composition
  the two actions: one-step-forward immediately followed by another
  one-step-forward can be composed to a single action: two-steps-forward

* Environment context = game-states
** Example
  "Jim dots, Jack 100" makes no sense w/o context
  - automatons: Mealy / Moore
