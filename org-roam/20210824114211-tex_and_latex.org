#+title: TeX and LaTex

* TeX & LaTeX
LaTeX is a document preparation system, a package containing a set of macros,
written by Leslie Lamport, built on top of TeX.

TeX is not just a typesetter, it is a typesetter with an embedded scripting
language, whose commands configure and control the behaviour of the typesetter.
LaTeX and Plain TeX are two different customised typesetting environments, with
their own commands and conventions, based on TeX (TeX is a "formatting system")

AUCTeX - an extensible package for writing and formatting TeX files in Emacs
