* Logic
  Study of the principles of inference and reasoning. It's not about "what is true".

  Inductive inference: \\
  We try to inference something about a phenomenon we don't understand. What properties it might have?

  Deductive inference: \\
  Something is true. What else can we derive from it?

  Inference rules:\\
  $$ \infer{Conclusion}{Premise} $$

  From the fact(s) / premise above the line we can deduce / assert / derive the
  fact / conclusion below the line. It may contain are schematic variables.

  Embedding intuitionistic logic into linear logic: \\
  $A \rightarrow B = \oc A \vdash B$ \\
  $A \times B = A \with B$ alternativelly $A \times B = \oc A \otimes \oc B$ \\
  $A + B = \oc A \oplus \oc B$
 
  Propositional Logic: AND, OR, NOT, IF-THEN, IS-EQUIVALENT-TO \\
  Predicate Logic: dependence on free variables, has Universal quantifiers, variables, functions \\
  Higher order logic

* Temporal logic
  Temporal Logic of Actions TLA^{+} developed by Leslie Lamport: \\
  It combines temporal logic with a logic of actions and describes behaviours of concurrent systems
  [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-4Yp3j_jk8Q&t][Thinking Above the Code]] [[http://lamport.azurewebsites.net/video/videos.html][The TLA^{+} Video Course]]

  Usefull models:
  Functions: \\
  map input to output; set of ordered pairs; Operating System - not an in/out mapping; runs forever (see sequence of states) \\
  sequence of states == behavior \\
  state: assignment of values to variables \\
  programm is modeled by a set of behaviors representing all possible executions

  Theorem: \\
  intersection of behaviors satisfying properties: \\
  Liveness L: a complete behavior is needed \\
  Safety S: e.g. partial correctness \\

  Specification: \\
  a set of possible init states (described using math!): uprimed variables
  next state relation: describes all possible successor states using math(!): primed variables

  Nondeterminism: \\
  multiple next states possible

  Formal specification: \\
  needed only to apply tools: TLA^{+}: Temporal Logic is for liveness \\
  Model checking of TLA^{+} spec

  Informal Specification: \\
  e.g. pretty-printing can't be exactly specified \\
  Set of rules/requiremens/axioms is usually a bad spec: consequesces of rules are hard to understand
