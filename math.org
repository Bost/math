* \(k\)-linear maps / transformations
** Linear map
Let $U$ and $W$ be vector spaces over the same field $K$. Function $f: U
\rightarrow W$ is a linear map between vector spaces (or modules over a
commutative Ring) $U$ and $W$ if for any two vectors $\vec{u}, \vec{v} \in U$
and any scalar $c \in K$ the following two conditions are satisfied:

\begin{enumerate}
\item addition
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
  f(\vec{u} + \vec{v}) = f(\vec{u}) + f(\vec{v})
\end{split}
\end{equation}

\item scalar multiplication i.e. homogeneity of degree 1
\begin{equation}
  f(c \cdot \vec{u}) = c \cdot f(\vec{u})
\end{equation}
\end{enumerate}

By the associativity of the addition $+$, for any vectors $\vec{u_1} \dotsc \vec{u_n} \in
U$ and scalars $c_1 \dotsc c_n \in K$ the following equality holds:

\begin{equation}
   f(c_1 \cdot \vec{u_1} + \dotsb + c_n \cdot \vec{u_n}) =
   c_1 \cdot f(\vec{u_1}) + \dotsb + c_n \cdot f(\vec{u_n})
\end{equation}

If $U = W$ the $f$ is a linear endomorphism of $V$.

Linearity meaning: can be drawn as a line.

Linear map in abstract algebra - module homomorphism

Linear map in category theory - morphism in the category of Modules over a given Ring

** Bilinear and multilinear map

Function $f: U_1 \times \dotsb \times U_k \rightarrow W$ is a \(k\)-linear map
between $k$ vector spaces (or modules over a commutative Ring) with the
following property:
  $\forall i = 1 \dots n$
if all of the vectors but $\vec{v_i}$ are held constant, then
  $f(\vec{v_1}, \dotsc \vec{v_i}, \dotsc \vec{v_n})$
is a linear function of $\vec{v_i}$.


For $k = 1$ the map is called linear, for $k = 2$ bilinear.

* Tensors
Generalization of matrices to \(n\)-dimensional space. Also \(n\)-dimensional
data containers with descriptions of the valid linear transformations between
tensors.

See \href{https://youtu.be/tpL95Sd7zT0}{Jim Fowler: Tensor products} \\

** Tensors as multidimensional arrays
*** Scalar
0-dimensional tensor, i.e. a single number. E.g: \\
\begin{equation}
\begin{matrix}
1
\end{matrix}
\end{equation}

Scalar (dot) product: takes two vectors, returns a single number

*** Vector
1-dimensional tensor. An arrow with a length and orientation. E.g.: \\
\begin{equation}
\begin{bmatrix}
1 \\
2
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

Can represent a quantity with magnitude and direction (e.g. area):
- orientation is perpendicular to the area
- length is proportional to the amount the area

Vector (cross) product: takes two vectors $\vec{v_1}$, $\vec{v_2}$, returns a
perpendicular vector. $\vec{v_1}$, $\vec{v_2}$ must be linearly independent,
i.e. one cannot by obtained (linearly combined) from the other.

*** Matrix
2-dimensional tensor. E.g.: \\
\begin{equation}
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 2 \\
3 & 4
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

Matrix product (multiplication): takes two matrices, returns a matrix. Number of
columns in the first matrix must be equal to the number of rows in the second
matrix

*** Multidimensional tensor
E.g. 3-dimensional tensor. E.g: \\
\begin{equation}
\begin{bmatrix}
  [ 1 & 2 ] & [1 & 0] \\
  [ 3 & 3 ] & [3 & 4]
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

??? Tensor product $\otimes$: most general bilinear operation ???

** Tensors as multilinear maps
TODO

* Hierarchy
What is needed to understand $X$? A big tree and paths through this tree.

Where leads understanding of $X_1, X_2, ..., X_n$? Prospects, applications in
other science fields, everyday life etc.

What's the next step? Why to study $Z$ and not $W$ after understanding $X_1,
X_2, ..., X_n$ in dependency of the field of some interest.

* Game Theory
Pure Strategy - set of decisions made with certitude. \\
Mixed Strategy - distribution of probabilities over some set of pure strategies.

** Nash Equilibrum
Each player gives best response to the others. Nobody has an incentive to
deviate from their actions if an equilibrum is played.

Example: Close windows to make air conditioning working: \\
Everybody just gives up without trying to convince others to close the window.

Example: Party organisation - follow the majority: \\
Majority joins - those skipping are penalized by "missed something". \\
Majority skips - those joining are penalized by "booring".

Nash Equilibrum TODOs:
1. Write action profiles for everyone (the matrix).
2. Calculate optimal mixed strategies for everyone in order to get Nash Equilibrum.
3. Calculate maxmin strategy and maxmin value (i.e. when the other guys do max harm to the i-th guy).

** Pareto Efficiency
Whenever all agents agree on ordering of outcomes the social welfare function
selects that ordering.

_Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives_: \\
If the selected ordering between two outcomes depends only on the relative
ordering they are given by the agents.

_Dictator_: \\
Single agent whose preferencies always determine the social ordering.

_Arrows Theorem_: \\
Any social welfare function that is pareto efficient and independent of
irrelevant alternatives is dictatorial.

** Markov chain (model)
[[https://youtu.be/o-jdJxXL_W4?t=423][Market transition]] \\
Dragan Djuric: Clojure on GPU \\
Bayadera (Bayesian): very fast \\
Bayesian is hard to compute, multi model, many dimensional problem, complex hyperspace \\
Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations (MCMC): difficult to parallelize \\
JAGS/Stan (state-of-the-art bayesian C++ tools)

* Hypotheses, Conjectures & Theorems
** Goldbach conjencture
Every even integer $n \in \{2,4,6, ...\}$ is a sum of two primes.

** Riemann hypothesis
[[https://youtu.be/sD0NjbwqlYw][3Blue1Brown: Visualizing the Riemann hypothesis and analytic continuation]]

The real part of every non-trivial zero of the Zeta function $\zeta$ is $1/2$
(prime numbers).\\
_Or:_ \\
All the nontrivial zeroes of the analytic continuation of the Riemann zeta
function $\zeta$ have a real part equal to $1/2$.

** Poincare conjencture
Every simply connected, closed 3-manifold is homeomorfic to the 3-sphere
(Donuts)

** P vs. NP
Every problem whose solution can be quickly verified by a computer can also be
quickly solved by a computer.

** Fermant's Last Theorem
With $n,x,y,z \in \mathbb{N}$ and $n > 2$, the equation $x^n + y^n = z^n$ has no solutions.

** Continuum hypothesis
There is no set with cardinality strictly between the cardinalities of integers
and real numbers. Notes: R surj P(N) (Power series - Mocninovy rad)

** Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetics
Every positive integer $n \in \mathbb{N}$ can be written in a unique way as a
product of primes. \\

- Generall test correctness: 0.09 + 0.63 = 0.72 (i.e. proper results for ill +
  proper results for healthy persons)
- Just guessing "everybody's healthy" gives 90% "generall test correctness"
  because the test is wrong only for ill patients and they make up 10% of the
  population.

** A posteriori conditional probability
$$P(B \mid A) = P(A \cap B) / P(B)$$

afternoon.

* Homology
Higher dimensional analogues for studying loops = (alternative to) Homotopy

Simplices: analogs of triangles in higher dimensions

* Fundamental group $\pi_2$ - loops of loops
Loops around sphere: captuers 2-dimensional hole in the sphere

$\pi_n$(S-k-upper-index) Homotopy group exists even if $n > k$; measuring higher
dimensional holes in k dimensional sphere

$\in$ is a containment relation

* Homotopy Type Theory
[[https://homotopytypetheory.org/][HoTT]] foundational framework; notions of paths in a space; equality and
quivalence.

Easier translation of mathematical proofs to a programming language of proof
assistants (than before).

** The Univalence Axiom
Identity is equivalent to equivalence, in particular: equivalent types are
identical.

For all types $A,B: \Pi A,B : Type.(A = B) \simeq (A \simeq B)$
- There's a function $UA: (A \simeq B) \rightarrow (A = B)$ such that from a
  proof equivalence of $A \simeq B$ it constructs a proof of equality $A = B$.
  Moreover a proof equivalence of $A \simeq B$ is equivalent to a proof of
  equality $A = B$. I.e. $(A \simeq B) \simeq (A = B)$.
- it allows to create a homotopy calculus w/o introduction of differential
  variety and even w/o an introduction of real numbers
Entier Relativ i.e. Set of Integers $\mathbb{Z}$.
