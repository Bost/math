### Semigroup / Halbgruppe (G, ∘):
    ∘ - closed / closure: a ∘ b must be also in G
    Not required: ∘ is commutative: x ∘ y = y ∘ x
    ∘ - associative: (x ∘ y) ∘ z = x ∘ (y ∘ z)
    Not required: e - neutral element (identity)
    Not required: x-inverse (dual obj): x ∘ x-inverse = x-inverse ∘ x = e
### Monoid (G, ∘, e): A category of 'many' morphisms and 'few' (only one) objs in G
    Group w/o inverse elements
    ∘ - closed / closure: a ∘ b must be also in G
    ∘ - associative: (x ∘ y) ∘ z = x ∘ (y ∘ z)

## Ring-like structures
### Semiring - Ring w/o additive inverse '-a'; Ring w/o i: R(i)ng
#### R - commutative i.e. abelian monoid under addition:
     + - associative:       (a + b) + c = a + (b + c)
     + - commutative:       a + b = b + a
     0 - additive identity: a + 0 = a
     Not required: additive inverse: every a has −a, the additive inverse: a + (−a) = 0
#### R - monoid under multiplication:
     · - associative:             (a · b) · c = a · (b · c)
     1 - multiplicative identity: a · 1 = 1 · a = a
#### Multiplication is distributive with respect to addition:
     left distributivity:  a · (b + c) = (a · b) + (a · c)
     right distributivity: (b + c) · a = (b · a) + (c · a)

### Near-ring
### Commutative ring
### Integral domain
### Field (TODO is Field a ring-like structure, really?)
https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2017/03/26/visualizing-kinds-of-rings/
- Euclidean domain: Every field is a Euclidean domain.
- Principal Ideal Domain: Every Euclidean domain is a principal ideal domain (PID).
- Unique Factorization Domain Every principal ideal domain is a unique factorization domain (UFD).
- Domain: Every unique factorization domain is an integral domain.
- Integral Domain: A finite integral domain is a field.

### Division ring
### Ring (R, +, ·) / Okruh
#### R -commutative i.e. abelian group under addition:
     + - associative:           (a + b) + c = a + (b + c)
     + - commutative:           a + b = b + a
     0 - additive identity: a + 0 = a
     every a has −a, the additive inverse: a + (−a) = 0
#### R - monoid under multiplication:
     · - associative:             (a · b) · c = a · (b · c)
     1 - multiplicative identity: a · 1 = 1 · a = a
#### Multiplication is distributive with respect to addition:
     left distributivity:  a · (b + c) = (a · b) + (a · c)
     right distributivity: (b + c) · a = (b · a) + (c · a)

### Boolean algebra
### Map of lattices
### Lattice theory

## Module-like
### Module - A vector space with a ring of scalars
### Group with operators
### Vector space a.k.a linear space
* Socratica - What is a Vector Space? https://youtu.be/ozwodzD5bJM __ E.g.
* Vector - an arrow with a length and direction; Vector Space - collection of
vectors
* Subject of Linear algebra i.e. study of vector spaces
